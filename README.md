# 👋 Hey there, I’m @SebaGGu619

- 🧠 I'm a Python-obsessed backend dev with a passion for hardware, automation, and making cool things that *just work*.
- 🛠️ I co-founded a tech company where I build serverless architectures on AWS (yes, it sounds fancy because it is).
- 🤖 I used to be the lead programmer in two robotics teams, and I still dabble in mechatronics and electronics—most recently designing a custom PCB for a smart fursuit head.
- 🧰 I’m also into 3D printing, SolidWorks modeling (I'm pretty cracked at it), DIY engineering, vacuum forming, and smart home automation.
- 💾 My homelab server setup is slowly becoming self-aware (20TB of high-speed NVME storage, fiber networking, and more madness incoming).
- 🌐 I know my way around Python, Java, C++, HTML/CSS/JS, Arduino C, and more. Basically, if it runs code, I’ll probably make it do weird stuff.
- 🎮 VR/XR is another huge interest—I've been exploring ways to blend physical and digital spaces through immersive tech.
- 🧡 I'm always looking for other chaotic good builders, hackers, artists, and mad scientists to make stuff with!
